# SWEDISH TRANSLATION FOR EBBINGHAUS/MÃœLLER-LYER ILLUSIONS EXPERIMENT

## START INSTRUCTIONS, 'welcome_txt'
In this test, you will do tasks which each involves a pair of objects.

In each task, you are to make sure that the objects' sizes are as similar as possible. To do this, you adjust the size of one of the objects.

To increase the size of an object, use the up arrow key. To reduce its size, use the down arrow key. When you think the objects are the same size, press space to confirm.

Before each task you will see a small green box. It shows where the object that you can resize will be located.

When you have finished reading, press space to begin.
